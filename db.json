        "Trivia": "64th Street: A Detective Story is the first brawler from Jaleco. They would go on to develop the Rushing Beat trilogy on SNES, which has similar Final Fight-style gameplay with a few extra gimmicks.One of the items in this game is the ghost from Avenging Spirit, another arcade game from Jaleco. You play as a recently deceased youth who avenges himself by possessing enemies.To unlock Very Easy and Mania difficulties, highlight the options menu, hold A + B on player 2's controller, hold C on player 1's controller, and press start. You can also now increase the number of lives to 9. To play as the same character in co-op, hold down-right + B on controller 1, left + A on controller 2, press C on controller 2, and then finally pick 2-player mode.",

On the plus side, you can play as defeated bosses.",

The only difference between the actual Japanese version is that Slash (aka Douglas Bild) is still black.This game, Rival Turf!, and The Peace Keepers are all actually part of the same series (Rushing Beat) in Japan. For some reason, the localization team treated each release as a separate game and changed the names of the characters.",

It's single player only, although it has three playable characters and RPG-style skillpoints that can be allocated at the end of each stage for extra health, damage, defense, and speed. Although its gameplay is shallow and it only has four enemies, it's unbelievably weird and has some really memorable bosses.\n",

Its combat is supposed to be built around alternating two attack buttons to pull off impressive combos, although it doesn't really matter which one you pick so it's basically a button-masher. The enemies are almost all pushovers and do little besides block. The graphics at least feature huge sprites, but are otherwise unremarkable.",

There's Double Dragon on the Neo Geo and Double Dragon V: Shadow Falls on the SNES. There's also a Neo Geo fighting game called Rage of the Dragons which was supposed to be a DD fighting game but got the license dropped during development.For some reason, thrown items like crates and barrels make the game lag considerably.

It also has some new anime-style custscenes.",

Compare Axel Stone to Ax=Battler, Blaze Fielding to Tyris Flare, and Max Thunder to Gilius Thunderhead.Golden Axe uses scream samples from the following films: Commando, Rambo: First Blood, Conan the Barbarian, and An American Werewolf in London.Golden Axe uses a unique \"Strength\" system rather than a traditional score. It's calculated as follows:\nStrength = ((0.5 + 0.5L) * E * A) * M. L is the current level you're on (1-5). E is for Enemy. Normal enemies count as 1, bosses are 2, and Death=adder is 8. A is for the attack you kill the enemy with. Banging the top of their head followed by a kick is 3, a normal kick or throw is 2, and anything else is 1. Finally, this is multiplied by M, your Magic Multiplier (see below.) At the end of the game, your Strength for all kills is aggregated and then divided by the number of times you died to calculate your final score.It is possible to increase your Strength by skillfully using magic. After you kill an enemy, every time you hit them with magic afterwards multiplies your Strength. If you line up a row of Pots and quickly use magic before the enemy hits the ground, you can achieve ridiculously high Strength scores.",

        "About": "\n\nKnights of the Round is a hack 'n' slash brawler from Capcom. It innovates in no less than four ways: it introduced a blocking mechanic that grants temporary invincibility, your character gains experience and changes appearance, items can be broken up and shared, and killing the same type of enemy consecutively grants a bonus. It also has a one-of-a-kind melodic medieval soundtrack.\n",
        "Trivia": "Knights of the Round is the least similar to Final Fight out of all Capcom's brawlers. Besides a death-blow attack, Knights of the Round distances itself from Capcom's genre-dominating classic by focusing on weapons-based combat against relatively few enemies and emphasizing advanced techniques.Every large item can be broken up into smaller pieces by attacking it. With the exception of the Salad, which can possibly go down in value, every other item grants more total points when broken apart. Do your best to attack every item and only grab it right away if it's about to disappear.Knights of the Round is the only brawler (and one of the few games, ever) where you change appearance as you level up. It's also the only arcade brawler with an experience system, although a small handful of console brawlers (most notably Double Dragon on NES) also use XP.Knights of the Round has a unique combo system. Killing the same type of enemy in a row multiplies the score by up to x4. Using this is key to leveling up all the way. In multiplayer games, everybody shares the same combo counter. Therefore, it's important to talk with your friends and try to kill enemies in the best order possible. Of course, this is hard if your friends suck at games.Knights of the Round has a unique blocking system that is unlike any other game. When you block an enemy's attack, you actually gain a few seconds of complete invincibility that you can use to punish the enemy with powerful attacks. Although blocking drags down almost every other brawler it's present in (see River City Ransom or Guardian Heroes), Knights of the Round does it right.",

The graphics and sound are about the best you can expect out of the Master System, and the OST has both Streets 1 and 2 music.",

It improves upon its predecessor across the board with deeper combat, more diverse characters, elaborate multi-part stages, and an even greater challenge. Its soundtrack is the stuff of legend.\n",
        "Trivia": "In the Japanese box art, Axel strongly resembles Jean-Claude Van Damme and Mr. X looks quite a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger.There are a few hidden tracks in the sound test that aren't present in the actual game. Track 9 is a hot little ditty entitled Little Money Avenue. It was originally intended for a bonus stage but that idea was scrapped during development.Yuzo Koshiro voices all the characters in this game. For Blaze, he sped up the recording to make it sound female.In the Japanese version, Blaze's jump kick has a different animation showing her panties. This was changed for obvious reasons in the US and PAL releases.The US version is known as Streets of Rage 2, in PAL regions it's Streets of Rage II, and in Japan it's known as Bare Knuckle II: The Requiem of the Deadly Battle.Streets of Rage II is available on a ton of platforms, including Game Gear, Sega Master System, PSN, Xbox Live, Wii, Steam, and even mobile phones.The \"It's like Boo!\" signs in the stadium stage are likely a reference to how the fat guy enemies have a similar flying bellyflop attack to the character Boo from the Dragonball Z series.Many enemy names are references to anime characters, mostly from Berserk and Fist of the North Star. Some examples are Caska, Griphis, Heart, and Vehelits.Konami seemed to rip-off Blaze's design for April O'Neil in TMNT: Tournament Fighters on the Genesis. The only thing distinguishing April are blue gloves and a bandanna.In the beta, Axel's stationary special attack was a spinning hurricane kick rather than his signature Dragon Wing. Also, Max's walk animation was more ape-like.When you enter a new area or defeat a wave on an elevator section, your health is restored slightly. Lower difficulties restore more health than challenging ones. This feature was likely implemented to give the player a greater incentive to use special attacks, which cost health. Therefore, you basically get one free special per area because it's going to be restored soon anyway.",

        "About": "\n\nStreets of Rage 3 is the explosive final chapter to Sega's outstanding console brawler franchise. It improves upon Streets 2 with star-based dash attacks, vertical rolling, rechargeable specials, semi-branching stages, tons of new enemies, and much faster gameplay. It also features a controversial new soundtrack based on underground Detroit techno. The US version was severely neutered with an altered story, removed content, and baffling color-swaps so this page will focus on Bare Knuckle III, the original Japanese release.\n",
        "Trivia": "Sega of America butchered Bare Knuckle III into Streets of Rage 3 in a handful of ways. First, they color-swapped the characters (and did an amateur job) which makes the sprites pop out less. Secondly, they changed the story and removed the bombing subplot. They also removed Ash, the gay stereotype character, which is somewhat understandable. Additionally, they made Streets of Rage 3 way, way harder and reduced the number of difficulty settings by 1. So, at least Streets 3 is appealing to truly experts Streets players because it offers the greatest challenge in the series.A large part of the soundtrack was generated by randomized beat generation software, apparently. Also, Yuzo did not directly compose most of the music and instead handed the reigns to his protege, Motohiro Kawashima.Yuzo recorded all the voices for Bare Knuckle III, but Sega of America used different actors for each character when they re-dubbed Streets 3.There are four endings: first, if you play on easy, the game will end immediately after defeating Robo X with a cutscene telling you to try harder. Second, if you fail to save the guy at the end of stage 6, you'll go to stage 7B and fight Shiva while Mr. X looks on from a far-off room. Third, if you reach Neo X and die, a bomb goes off and you get the bad ending. Finally, if you beat Neo X in time, you'll get the good ending.Max and Adam from the previous games appear in the credits.Streets of Rage 3 is available on Genesis, Steam, PSN and Xbox Live.Otohime and Yasha's team-based projectile attack is actually a fat man riding a horse.Axel's headband-tying intro scene in Bare Knuckle III is a rip-off of the same scene from Rambo III.Every time you get 40,000 points without dying, you gain a star. If you die, you lose a star and your point counter is reset (meaning if you die with 50,000 points, you need to get 90,000 points for another star.) Stars permanently upgrade your dash-attack. You can also execute your star moves with cheater combos using the X button on the Genesis 6-button controller. See the Fighters tab for more info.The beta version featured motorcycle segments where a Donovan on the back of a truck would throw barrels at you while bikers ride by and toss grenades. This was cut before the final release but was restored in Streets of Rage Remake. ",

It deepens the combat of its predecessors by adding a block move that becomes a grab when executed successfully as well as a charged energy bar that enables advanced techniques. It's a two-player game, and the only Double Dragon where Billy and Jimmy aren't color-swaps of one another. Unfortunately, it was rushed to release so it's a little rough around the edges.\n",
        "Trivia": "This game originally had a story but it was cut because it was rushed out. In this version, Miriam is supposed to be a cop.The Japanese version is very slightly different. Weapons do less damage and you can now catch boomerangs when they return.",

Also, each dwarf counts as a hitpoint that can be regained by attacking him when he's down.\n",

It features simple yet challenging gameplay, bizarre enemy design, phenomenal audiovisual presentation, and a one-of-a-kind personality. It introduced the concept of ultimate attacks, which are basically death-blows on steroids. It also has a unique \"Finess Trick\" system that rewards using advanced techniques.\n",
        "Trivia": "Undercover Cops is basically an alternate version of Final Fight. Zan is Guy, Rosa is Cody, and Matt is Haggar. Dr. Crayton, like Belger, is a short, cheating bad guy who has an easy first form followed by a hard second. And both games are about a city overrun by crime that has to be cleaned up by three vigilantes.The US port of Undercover Cops is one of the worst cases of executive meddling in any brawler, perhaps even worse than Streets of Rage III. They renamed the characters and changed their backstories, removed about half the attacks, took out or changed several pieces of background art, and removed the voice samples from the music. There existed an Alpha version at some point that didn't have these issues, and there's even an Alpha Renewal kit that restored the normal version to its former glory, although both of these are ridiculously rare.Undercover Cops has a board game RPG (similar to Sugoro Quest) spin-off on the Game Boy called Undercover Cops Hakaishin Garumaa. It's barely playable if you don't speak Japanese although the characters are the only thing that makes it an \"Undercover Cops\" game.One of the items in this game is R-Type. R-Type is Irem's most successful franchise by far. It's a hard-as-nails space shooter with an H.R. Giger art style.",

Although it features goofy humor, 4-player simultaneous gameplay, and moderate challenge, it breaks from tradition with its huge movesets and strong emphasis on items. In fact, this is hands-down the most weapons-heavy beat 'em up. It's got bats, knives, whips, chains, and even a shotgun.\n",
        "Trivia": "Vendetta is one of the only brawlers with fighters that feature realistic human proportions. Blood, Boomer, and Sledge have musculature that can be realistically achieved without the use of steroids.  Although Hawk is huge, he's actually a little smaller than Hulk Hogan in his prime.Vendetta is the US version of Crime Fighters 2. Like Crime Fighters before it, several elements were removed in the US release. Most notably, the gay stereotype and humping dog enemies have been completely cut.",

        "overallReview": "Zero Team is awesome. The distinct characters and dynamic combos make the combat a lot of fun. Although the sprites are fairly small, they're detailed and the color usage is off the chain. The backgrounds look especially excellent. Unfortunately, the music is just awful. It could also be a little harder and longer.",

        "Platform": "SNES",
        "About": "\n\nZoku: The Legend of Bishin is a Super Famicom exclusive brawler/racer hybrid. It mainly features Mode 7 racing where you must rush to the target and beat the time limit. When you crash your car, you get thrown from it and the game turns into a brawler. Bosses are also fought with traditional beat 'em up combat.\n",
        "Trivia": "There are secret codes that let you change the color of your car.This game features one of the worst cases of rubber-band AI ever: enemies will be slow until you pass them, at which point they're way faster than you and hit you in the butt. Try to drive safely behind most enemies because out-pacing them is rarely worth it.",

        "overallReview": "Zoku: The Legend of Bishin is just awful. It fails completely as a racing game, which is unfortunately what you do most of the time. As a brawler, it's just passable and shallower than a half-filled kiddy pool. This could have been a groundbreaking game, but it's little more than a tech demo for two disparate yet completely unfinished games.",
