    "about": "64th Street: A Detective Story is a gumshoe-themed beat 'em up from Jaleco. It's claim to fame is the ability to throw enemies into the background, which breaks walls and reveals items. Besides that, it follows closely in the footsteps of Final Fight.",
    "trivia": "64th Street: A Detective Story is the first brawler from Jaleco. They would go on to develop the Rushing Beat trilogy on SNES, which has similar Final Fight-style gameplay with a few extra gimmicks.One of the items in this game is the ghost from Avenging Spirit, another arcade game from Jaleco. You play as a recently deceased youth who avenges himself by possessing enemies.To unlock Very Easy and Mania difficulties, highlight the options menu, hold A + B on player 2's controller, hold C on player 1's controller, and press start. You can also now increase the number of lives to 9. To play as the same character in co-op, hold down-right + B on controller 1, left + A on controller 2, press C on controller 2, and then finally pick 2-player mode.",

Its strengths are the throwing enemies into the background gimmick and its goofy personality. The music ain't nothing special, though. Jaleco would later go on to develop the Rushing Beat series of games.",

It's also the only mech brawler in existence, so it gets points for originality. However, it can get extremely hectic at times, especially with three players.",

It's a Final Fight-esque beat 'em up with a cartoony style, five playable characters, and surprisingly steep challenge. It also maintains its predecessor's \"Ikari mode\" which grants a brief invincibility period when you're low on health.\n",
    "trivia": "The US version actually has the full Japanese version as a hidden bonus. Press X,A,B,Y repeatedly when the Jaleco logo appears. You'll come to a screen with garbled graphics. Press down twice and then start. Finally, leave the menu and you're now playing Rushing Beat Ran instead of Brawl Brothers! The only difference between the actual Japanese version is that Slash (aka Douglas Bild) is still black.This game, Rival Turf!, and The Peace Keepers are all actually part of the same series (Rushing Beat) in Japan. For some reason, the localization team treated each release as a separate game and changed the names of the characters.",

There are five very distinct characters with well-designed movesets, the style is far more cartoony, and the enemies are more unique (although less amusing.) It has surprisingly good core combat and lasts a long time. My biggest complaint is the small sprites.",

Every aspect of its design is oozing with that juicy Capcom quality you know and love. Although it lacks a gameplay gimmick, its combat is extremely tight and satisfying. Its phenomenal presentation is backed by its one-of-a-kind setting.",

    "overallReview": "Captain Commando is easily the worst SNES Capcom brawler. Its combat seriously lacks a sense of impact, the mechs and weapons from the original were largely removed, and the graphics and sound are of notably average quality. On the positive side, the challenge is solid, it's fairly long, and the character designs are extremely weird and hilarious.",

    "overallReview": "Dancing Sword is mediocre. Its combat is supposed to be built around alternating two attack buttons to pull off impressive combos, although it doesn't really matter which one you pick so it's basically a button-masher. The enemies are almost all pushovers and do little besides block. The graphics at least feature huge sprites, but are otherwise unremarkable.",

Although Renegade came out first, Double Dragon was the first internationally successful brawler. Its unprecedented co-op gameplay, expansive movesets, and iconic soundtrack allowed it to dominate the arcade beat 'em up scene for several years and solidify its status as a cultural phenomenon. To this day it remains one of the most widely recognized brawlers.\n",
    "trivia": "As of 2014, Double Dragon has been ported to over 20 platforms, ranging from old computers like ZX Spectrum to Android. A Double Dragon live action movie was released in 1994. It was critically panned and followed the game's story and characters only very loosely. Technōs attempted to convert Double Dragon to a fighting game, twice. There's Double Dragon on the Neo Geo and Double Dragon V: Shadow Falls on the SNES. There's also a Neo Geo fighting game called Rage of the Dragons which was supposed to be a DD fighting game but got the license dropped during development.For some reason, thrown items like crates and barrels make the game lag considerably. Try to throw them offscreen to increase the framerate.",

Despite its huge (although wildly imbalanced) moveset, stiff challenge, and extremely iconic OST, this game is dragged down by a single glaring flaw: it lags constantly. Whenever there are too many enemies onscreen, or just a single barrel, the action slows down to an unbearable crawl.",

The enemy variety is awful, and the 3D graphics look way worse than the awesome concept art. At least the core combat is generally well-designed and the music is off the chain.",

The limp music is throwaway atmospheric orchestral garbage.",

Even its art style, featuring gigantic sprites and outlandish enemy design, defined the following decade of beat 'em up games.\n",
    "trivia": "Final Fight was originally entitled \"Street Fighter '89\" but was renamed due to fan confusion concerning the name.Final Fight's plot is heavily based off of the 1984 film \"Streets of Fire\" which features a knife expert named Tom Cody who has to take down a street gang that kidnapped his girlfriend.Final Fight's plot is heavily based off of the 1984 film \"Streets of Fire\" which features a knife expert named Tom Cody who has to take down a street gang that kidnapped his girlfriend.Almost every enemy and boss is modeled after an 80's pop culture icon. See the Enemies tab for more info.Cody, Guy, Sodom, and Andore (aka Hugo) all appear in Street Fighter games starting with the Alpha series. Haggar appears in Marvel Vs. Capcom 3.There are three Final Fight spin-offs: Final Fight Revenge, which is a 3D fighting game released in arcades and later ported to the Sega Saturn, Final Fight Streetwise, which is a 3D open-world brawler on the PS2, and Mighty Final Fight, which is an NES \"parody\" version (in the same vein as Parodius).",

Due to the fact that it was an early game for the console and cartridge space was limited, Capcom had to make three serious cuts: Guy was completely removed, as was the Industrial Area stage, and it's a single-player only game. Furthermore, there are only three simultaneous enemies at once. Despite that, it's still Final Fight, and it has a ton of personality, memorable enemies, and satisfying gameplay.\n",
    "trivia": "For the US version, Poison and Roxy were changed to dudes (Sid and Billy) because Nintendo didn't want to see violence towards women on their system. They didn't care that Poison and perhaps Roxy are actually dudes.This game was ported to the GBA as Final Fight One. It restores the missing stage, Guy, and has as many onscreen enemies as the arcade version.",

Its challenge and length are both moderate.",

The backgrounds are lame, but the characters feature huge sprites and fluid animation. It's really short yet super hard at the same time. If you can put up with its quirks, this is one of the better GBA brawlers.",

Its weapons-based combat, screen-clearing magic attacks, mountable creatures, and barbarian aesthetic made it one of Sega's most successful early franchises. It's also notable for its short playtime, casual difficulty, and unique scoring system.\n",
    "trivia": "Golden Axe was developed by the same team as Altered Beast. Both games share the Chicken-Leg enemy.The characters in Streets of Rage II are named similarly to Golden Axe's fighters. Compare Axel Stone to Ax=Battler, Blaze Fielding to Tyris Flare, and Max Thunder to Gilius Thunderhead.Golden Axe uses scream samples from the following films: Commando, Rambo: First Blood, Conan the Barbarian, and An American Werewolf in London.Golden Axe uses a unique \"Strength\" system rather than a traditional score. It's calculated as follows:\nStrength = ((0.5 + 0.5L) * E * A) * M. L is the current level you're on (1-5). E is for Enemy. Normal enemies count as 1, bosses are 2, and Death=adder is 8. A is for the attack you kill the enemy with. Banging the top of their head followed by a kick is 3, a normal kick or throw is 2, and anything else is 1. Finally, this is multiplied by M, your Magic Multiplier (see below.) At the end of the game, your Strength for all kills is aggregated and then divided by the number of times you died to calculate your final score.It is possible to increase your Strength by skillfully using magic. After you kill an enemy, every time you hit them with magic afterwards multiplies your Strength. If you line up a row of Pots and quickly use magic before the enemy hits the ground, you can achieve ridiculously high Strength scores.",

It innovates in no less than four ways: it introduced a blocking mechanic that grants temporary invincibility, your character gains experience and changes appearance, items can be broken up and shared, and killing the same type of enemy consecutively grants a bonus. It also has a one-of-a-kind melodic medieval soundtrack.\n",
    "trivia": "Knights of the Round is the least similar to Final Fight out of all Capcom's brawlers. Besides a death-blow attack, Knights of the Round distances itself from Capcom's genre-dominating classic by focusing on weapons-based combat against relatively few enemies and emphasizing advanced techniques.Every large item can be broken up into smaller pieces by attacking it. With the exception of the Salad, which can possibly go down in value, every other item grants more total points when broken apart. Do your best to attack every item and only grab it right away if it's about to disappear.Knights of the Round is the only brawler (and one of the few games, ever) where you change appearance as you level up. It's also the only arcade brawler with an experience system, although a small handful of console brawlers (most notably Double Dragon on NES) also use XP.Knights of the Round has a unique combo system. Killing the same type of enemy in a row multiplies the score by up to x4. Using this is key to leveling up all the way. In multiplayer games, everybody shares the same combo counter. Therefore, it's important to talk with your friends and try to kill enemies in the best order possible. Of course, this is hard if your friends suck at games.Knights of the Round has a unique blocking system that is unlike any other game. When you block an enemy's attack, you actually gain a few seconds of complete invincibility that you can use to punish the enemy with powerful attacks. Although blocking drags down almost every other brawler it's present in (see River City Ransom or Guardian Heroes), Knights of the Round does it right.",

It also has action platformer sections as well as a handful of minigames.\n",

It's an excellent successor to the (unrelated) River City Ransom games, although the RPG element basically boils down to buying items. The action platformer stages are definitely the hardest part of the game, and the bosses are fun and varied.",

Although it has a cool alternate gameplay mode with giant sprites, the core brawler gameplay is overly simplistic, has small sprites, and average enemy variety. At least the challenge and music are both solid. This is worth playing for its originality and gimmick moreso than sheer quality.",

    "trivia": "Mighty Final Fight is actually the third Final Fight game released, as it came out after Final Fight 2 on the SNES. The composers for this game, Setsuo Yamamoto and Yujo Takehara, also composed for Mega Man X, Final Fight 2, and a couple of Street Fighter games. This game has the opposite ending of Final Fight: instead of Guy beating up Cody because he was walking away from Jessica, Guy has to restrain horndog Cody from ruining Haggar's special moment with his daughter. This game is heavily influenced by the NES version of Double Dragon. Both games feature combat against two opponents at once and have an experience system where each move grants different XP and you gain new moves by leveling up. Mighty Final Fight is available on the GBA as part of Capcom Mini-Mix alongside Bionic Commando and Strider.",

It has an absurd visual style including a main character that's wearing red leopard pants and white sunglasses.\n",
    "trivia": "The characters sprites in this game were clearly traced from Combatribes. Also, the stage over music was stolen from that game.Most of the enemies in this game are rip-offs of Final Fight.

However, its combat is still fairly varied and satisfying thanks to its large movesets. It has a surprisingly strong personality featuring plenty of goofy character designs.",

Its combat engine is actually more similar to the very first Kunio game (i.e. Renegade) than Downtown Special (aka River City Ransom.) It also adds a crouch move that can be followed up with a mighty spinning uppercut as well as a gut-jumping attack. It features three difficulty settings and link cable support for two-player gameplay.\n",
    "trivia": "This game was re-worked into Double Dragon II on the Game Boy (it has different graphics and music) for US audiences.This is the only Kunio game with stun-based grabs, a gut-jump attack, a crouch move, or a flying uppercut.",

I personally like DD2's music better, but this isn't much worse. It's a great game to beat in one sitting, although the combat could use some work because uppercuts dominate the gameplay.",

If you can stomach the gameplay the art style could be worth it if you're into gross-out stuff.",

The labyrinth is dubious, though.",

If it weren't for all the padding, this could be a great game thanks to its decent presentation.",

Its ultra-catchy soundtrack is composed by Taito's legendary house band, Zuntata.\n",

However, these were kept for this release as the Hit Stages between levels. Of course, there's no punching bag, so you have to rotate the D-pad instead.Like the US localization of Final Fight before it, female enemies in this game were changed to males to appease Nintendo of America's censorship policies.There's also Sonic Blast Man II on SNES, but it's completely different. It abandons the innovative gameplay for something far more generic and has way smaller sprites, but at least it's two-player.",

The time gimmick is original but boils down to memorizing the best path so you avoid a big chunk of the game. The gore is surprisingly tame for the most part but there are legit gross-out moments.",

However, he would later make an appearance in Streets of Rage Remake on the PC.The cop car in the screen-clearing special attack animation is from another Sega game, Cyber Police E-SWAT. Additionally, the original title for this game was going to be Dragon SWAT or D-SWAT.Streets was developed by several members from Team Shinobi, who of course worked on the Shinobi series. It features the same font and several sound effects from Return of Shinobi on the Genesis.Streets of Rage is available on several modern platforms, including PSN, Xbox Live, Steam, Wii, 3DS, and even mobile phones. It's also part of the 6-Pak compilation on Sega Genesis along with Golden Axe.Streets of Rage was playable in arcades on Sega's Mega-Tech hardware, which was basically just a Genesis in an arcade cabinet.If you wait around on the character select screen long enough, Blaze will wink at you.Check out http://www.soronline.net for more Streets info!",

For Blaze, he sped up the recording to make it sound female.In the Japanese version, Blaze's jump kick has a different animation showing her panties. This was changed for obvious reasons in the US and PAL releases.The US version is known as Streets of Rage 2, in PAL regions it's Streets of Rage II, and in Japan it's known as Bare Knuckle II: The Requiem of the Deadly Battle.Streets of Rage II is available on a ton of platforms, including Game Gear, Sega Master System, PSN, Xbox Live, Wii, Steam, and even mobile phones.The \"It's like Boo!\" signs in the stadium stage are likely a reference to how the fat guy enemies have a similar flying bellyflop attack to the character Boo from the Dragonball Z series.Many enemy names are references to anime characters, mostly from Berserk and Fist of the North Star. Some examples are Caska, Griphis, Heart, and Vehelits.Konami seemed to rip-off Blaze's design for April O'Neil in TMNT: Tournament Fighters on the Genesis. The only thing distinguishing April are blue gloves and a bandanna.In the beta, Axel's stationary special attack was a spinning hurricane kick rather than his signature Dragon Wing. Also, Max's walk animation was more ape-like.When you enter a new area or defeat a wave on an elevator section, your health is restored slightly. Lower difficulties restore more health than challenging ones. This feature was likely implemented to give the player a greater incentive to use special attacks, which cost health. Therefore, you basically get one free special per area because it's going to be restored soon anyway.",

The graphics are vibrant and feature much larger sprites, while the soundtrack is beyond legendary.",

    "about": "\n\nStreets of Rage 3 is the explosive final chapter to Sega's outstanding console brawler franchise. It improves upon Streets 2 with star-based dash attacks, vertical rolling, rechargeable specials, semi-branching stages, tons of new enemies, and much faster gameplay. It also features a controversial new soundtrack based on underground Detroit techno. The US version was severely neutered with an altered story, removed content, and baffling color-swaps so this page will focus on Bare Knuckle III, the original Japanese release.\n",
    "trivia": "Sega of America butchered Bare Knuckle III into Streets of Rage 3 in a handful of ways. First, they color-swapped the characters (and did an amateur job) which makes the sprites pop out less. Secondly, they changed the story and removed the bombing subplot. They also removed Ash, the gay stereotype character, which is somewhat understandable. Additionally, they made Streets of Rage 3 way, way harder and reduced the number of difficulty settings by 1. So, at least Streets 3 is appealing to truly experts Streets players because it offers the greatest challenge in the series.A large part of the soundtrack was generated by randomized beat generation software, apparently. Also, Yuzo did not directly compose most of the music and instead handed the reigns to his protege, Motohiro Kawashima.Yuzo recorded all the voices for Bare Knuckle III, but Sega of America used different actors for each character when they re-dubbed Streets 3.There are four endings: first, if you play on easy, the game will end immediately after defeating Robo X with a cutscene telling you to try harder. Second, if you fail to save the guy at the end of stage 6, you'll go to stage 7B and fight Shiva while Mr. X looks on from a far-off room. Third, if you reach Neo X and die, a bomb goes off and you get the bad ending. Finally, if you beat Neo X in time, you'll get the good ending.Max and Adam from the previous games appear in the credits.Streets of Rage 3 is available on Genesis, Steam, PSN and Xbox Live.Otohime and Yasha's team-based projectile attack is actually a fat man riding a horse.Axel's headband-tying intro scene in Bare Knuckle III is a rip-off of the same scene from Rambo III.Every time you get 40,000 points without dying, you gain a star. If you die, you lose a star and your point counter is reset (meaning if you die with 50,000 points, you need to get 90,000 points for another star.) Stars permanently upgrade your dash-attack. You can also execute your star moves with cheater combos using the X button on the Genesis 6-button controller. See the Fighters tab for more info.The beta version featured motorcycle segments where a Donovan on the back of a truck would throw barrels at you while bikers ride by and toss grenades. This was cut before the final release but was restored in Streets of Rage Remake. ",

It takes Streets 3's ingenious combat system and applies it to all the content from the trilogy with amazing accuracy. It's blisteringly difficult yet infinitely satisfying, and there's so much content here that it has huge replayability. Plus, it's completely free!",

    "trivia": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an adaptation of the 1987 cartoon series of the same name. Although the comic series came before, it lacked most of the iconic characters like Rocksteady, Bebop, Baxter Stockman, and Krang.Throws in this game don't work like any other brawler. Basically you get a free throw when you defeat an enemy. See the Fighters section for more info.In Europe, TMNT are known as the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles. Due to the fact that the holocaust happened there, Europe (and especially Germany) has far harsher censorship than the US. The term \"Ninja\" was deemed too violent so it was changed to \"Hero\" instead.This is the only TMNT game where you fight Baxter Stockman in his human form. In all other titles, you fight him after he's mutated into a fly-man.",

This works in both brawler and platformer segments but not during vehicle stages.",

Thankfully, Konami contributed this masterpiece of a brawler that's just exploding with personality, creativity, and variety. Looking back on it critically as an adult, it's definitely way too easy, and it'd be nice if there were more non-foot soldier enemies.",

It also has some RPG elements.",

It features simple yet challenging gameplay, bizarre enemy design, phenomenal audiovisual presentation, and a one-of-a-kind personality. It introduced the concept of ultimate attacks, which are basically death-blows on steroids. It also has a unique \"Finess Trick\" system that rewards using advanced techniques.\n",
    "trivia": "Undercover Cops is basically an alternate version of Final Fight. Zan is Guy, Rosa is Cody, and Matt is Haggar. Dr. Crayton, like Belger, is a short, cheating bad guy who has an easy first form followed by a hard second. And both games are about a city overrun by crime that has to be cleaned up by three vigilantes.The US port of Undercover Cops is one of the worst cases of executive meddling in any brawler, perhaps even worse than Streets of Rage III. They renamed the characters and changed their backstories, removed about half the attacks, took out or changed several pieces of background art, and removed the voice samples from the music. There existed an Alpha version at some point that didn't have these issues, and there's even an Alpha Renewal kit that restored the normal version to its former glory, although both of these are ridiculously rare.Undercover Cops has a board game RPG (similar to Sugoro Quest) spin-off on the Game Boy called Undercover Cops Hakaishin Garumaa. It's barely playable if you don't speak Japanese although the characters are the only thing that makes it an \"Undercover Cops\" game. One of the items in this game is R-Type. R-Type is Irem's most successful franchise by far. It's a hard-as-nails space shooter with an H.R. Giger art style.",

    "overallReview": "Undercover Cops is a shockingly faithful port and easily one of the best looking and sounding games ever released for the SNES. It features huge movesets, plenty of enemy variety, master-level pixel art, and an intense hip hop soundtrack. My only complaint is that a lot of the later enemies are gimmicky.",

In fact, this is hands-down the most weapons-heavy beat 'em up. It's got bats, knives, whips, chains, and even a shotgun.\n",
    "trivia": "Vendetta is one of the only brawlers with fighters that feature realistic human proportions. Blood, Boomer, and Sledge have musculature that can be realistically achieved without the use of steroids. Although Hawk is huge, he's actually a little smaller than Hulk Hogan in his prime. Vendetta is the US version of Crime Fighters 2. Like Crime Fighters before it, several elements were removed in the US release. Most notably, the gay stereotype and humping dog enemies have been completely cut.",

Interestingly, there are throws although weaker characters can't throw heavier enemies. That being said, there's a cool stage select setup and decent variety.",

    "about": "\n\nX-Men: Reign of Apocalypse is a single-player GBA-exclusive brawler based off the Marvel Comics franchise. You can play as Wolverine, Rogue, Storm, or Cyclops. Its combat features an energy-based ultimate attack as well as special techniques with Street Fighter-style inputs. It also has light RPG elements in the form of stat upgrades between stages. Its graphics are smoothly animated and vibrant while its soundtrack is a mixture of rock and techno.\n",
    "trivia": "This game also features X-Men favorites like Nightcrawler and Gambit, but they only appear as bosses.To execute a special attack, press quarter-cirle-forwards (down, down-right, right) + A.",

    "overallReview": "Reign of Apocalypse has great graphics and some solid beats. But unfortunately, its extremely simple gameplay and horrible enemy variety make this game extremely repetitive and somewhat of a chore to beat. It adds light RPG elements to try to make things more interesting, but that doesn't change the fact that you fight the same few enemies constantly.",
