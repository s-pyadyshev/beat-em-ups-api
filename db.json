    "about": "64th Street: A Detective Story is a gumshoe-themed beat 'em up from Jaleco. It's claim to fame is the ability to throw enemies into the background, which breaks walls and reveals items. Besides that, it follows closely in the footsteps of Final Fight.",
    "trivia": "64th Street: A Detective Story is the first brawler from Jaleco. They would go on to develop the Rushing Beat trilogy on SNES, which has similar Final Fight-style gameplay with a few extra gimmicks. One of the items in this game is the ghost from Avenging Spirit, another arcade game from Jaleco. You play as a recently deceased youth who avenges himself by possessing enemies. To unlock Very Easy and Mania difficulties, highlight the options menu, hold A + B on player 2's controller, hold C on player 1's controller, and press start. You can also now increase the number of lives to 9. To play as the same character in co-op, hold down-right + B on controller 1, left + A on controller 2, press C on controller 2, and then finally pick 2-player mode.",

Its strengths are the throwing enemies into the background gimmick and its goofy personality. The music ain't nothing special, though. Jaleco would later go on to develop the Rushing Beat series of games."

Additionally, it adds a unique death system where you have the option to play through the rest of the stage with invincibility when you die (although it's Game Over when you finish the level.) \n",
    "trivia": "Moreso than the original Guardian Heroes, this game strongly resembles Treasure's first game: Gunstar Heroes on the Genesis, which is a Contra-style shooter. The characters featured in the intro cutscene were the playable fighters in the first game.",

Asterix is the * symbol, which signifies a \"wildcard\", Obelix means \"obelisk\", a giant rock, and Getafix is obvious.",

It also maintains its predecessor's \"Ikari mode\" which grants a brief invincibility period when you're low on health.\n",
    "trivia": "The US version actually has the full Japanese version as a hidden bonus. Press X,A,B,Y repeatedly when the Jaleco logo appears. You'll come to a screen with garbled graphics. Press down twice and then start. Finally, leave the menu and you're now playing Rushing Beat Ran instead of Brawl Brothers! The only difference between the actual Japanese version is that Slash (aka Douglas Bild) is still black. This game, Rival Turf!, and The Peace Keepers are all actually part of the same series (Rushing Beat) in Japan. For some reason, the localization team treated each release as a separate game and changed the names of the characters.",

It plays a lot like Final Fight and has the same bizarre sense of humor but takes it up a notch with a \"very cool \" blade-wielding mummy-alien and a baby that controls a mech.\n",
    "trivia": "Most of the side weapons were removed from the arcade version, as well as the mechs that you could ride around in. The huge \"women\" enemies in the Ninja stage are probably dudes. They make a deep grunting sound when you defeat them. Likely this is a reference to how in ancient Japan women were prohibited from performing in Kabuki theater so men had to play the parts of women instead.",

    "about": "\n\nCrest of Wolf (known as Riot Zone in the US) is a semi-port of Westone's obscure arcade brawler, Riot City. Like the original, its gameplay is a shameless knock-off of Final Fight but with even fewer moves. Also, it's single-player only.  This version features slightly remixed stages, a different player two character, and a rockin' new CD-quality soundtrack.\n",
    "trivia": "The main character in this game is a blatant rip-off of Cody from Final Fight. His main distinguishing feature is his ridiculous death-blow attack. In the arcade version, the second character is a breakdancing black guy. In this version, he's a breakdancing white guy with a mohawk and star tattoos on his face.",

Somehow, Konami kept the franchise going with the excellent Vendetta (aka Crime Fighters 2) and Violent Storm. Certain humor elements were removed from the international release. An animated bikini butt in the subway was removed, as well as a poster of giant lips that licks you when you get too close.",

Although Renegade came out first, Double Dragon was the first internationally successful brawler. Its unprecedented co-op gameplay, expansive movesets, and iconic soundtrack allowed it to dominate the arcade beat 'em up scene for several years and solidify its status as a cultural phenomenon. To this day it remains one of the most widely recognized brawlers.\n",
    "trivia": "As of 2014, Double Dragon has been ported to over 20 platforms, ranging from old computers like ZX Spectrum to Android. A Double Dragon live action movie was released in 1994. It was critically panned and followed the game's story and characters only very loosely. Technōs attempted to convert Double Dragon to a fighting game, twice. There's Double Dragon on the Neo Geo and Double Dragon V: Shadow Falls on the SNES. There's also a Neo Geo fighting game called Rage of the Dragons which was supposed to be a DD fighting game but got the license dropped during development. For some reason, thrown items like crates and barrels make the game lag considerably. Try to throw them offscreen to increase the framerate.",

    "about": "\n\nDouble Dragon Neon is a modern revamp of Technos' classic genre-defining brawler series available on PSN and Xbox Live. It keeps the series' punch/kick button setup but adds a throw button and gets rid of a lot of moves like knees to the face. However, it adds an RPG element where you have a stance that affects your stats as well as an upgradeable special attack that costs energy. It has a humorous style and an excellent 80's rock soundtrack composed by Jake Kaufman.\n",
    "trivia": "This game was made by WayForward, who also made Contra 4, another modern take on a beloved classic franchise. If you talk to the shopkeeper, he mentions how the Dragons used to grab enemies by the hair and knee them in the face. This is basically the developers hanging lampshades around the fact that they removed one of the series' most iconic attacks.",

It has a unique surreal oil painting visual style that the developer Vanillaware is known for. It plays like an updated version of Capcom's D&D brawlers but with a far stronger emphasis on RPG elements, namely equipment management. It features six distinct fighters with large, diverse movesets that can be upgraded with experience. It also has a cursor that lets you click on the background to find treasure.\n",
    "trivia": "Vanillaware also made an action platformer called Odin Sphere that has brawler-esque elements but 2D gameplay. You can grow a fruit and then eat it to level up your maximum hit points. There's also Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and Princess Crown on Dreamcast. George Kamitani, the main man behind Vanillaware, worked on Capcom's Dungeons and Dragons arcade games, thus the similarity in gameplay and setting.",

It introduced concepts like unique playable characters, contact-based grabs, and health-draining \"death-blow\" attacks that would all become genre standards. Even its art style, featuring gigantic sprites and outlandish enemy design, defined the following decade of beat 'em up games.\n",
    "trivia": "Final Fight was originally entitled \"Street Fighter '89\" but was renamed due to fan confusion concerning the name. Final Fight's plot is heavily based off of the 1984 film \"Streets of Fire\" which features a knife expert named Tom Cody who has to take down a street gang that kidnapped his girlfriend. Final Fight's plot is heavily based off of the 1984 film \"Streets of Fire\" which features a knife expert named Tom Cody who has to take down a street gang that kidnapped his girlfriend. Almost every enemy and boss is modeled after an 80's pop culture icon. See the Enemies tab for more info. Cody, Guy, Sodom, and Andore (aka Hugo) all appear in Street Fighter games starting with the Alpha series. Haggar appears in Marvel Vs. Capcom 3. There are three Final Fight spin-offs: Final Fight Revenge, which is a 3D fighting game released in arcades and later ported to the Sega Saturn, Final Fight Streetwise, which is a 3D open-world brawler on the PS2, and Mighty Final Fight, which is an NES \"parody\" version (in the same vein as Parodius).",

Due to the fact that it was an early game for the console and cartridge space was limited, Capcom had to make three serious cuts: Guy was completely removed, as was the Industrial Area stage, and it's a single-player only game. Furthermore, there are only three simultaneous enemies at once. Despite that, it's still Final Fight, and it has a ton of personality, memorable enemies, and satisfying gameplay.\n",
    "trivia": "For the US version, Poison and Roxy were changed to dudes (Sid and Billy) because Nintendo didn't want to see violence towards women on their system. They didn't care that Poison and perhaps Roxy are actually dudes. This game was ported to the GBA as Final Fight One. It restores the missing stage, Guy, and has as many onscreen enemies as the arcade version.",

Although it features the same graphics as the SNES port, it restores Guy and the missing industrial stage as well as adding system-link co-op gameplay. It also features tons of onscreen enemies, remixed enemy waves, alternate costumes for Cody and Guy, and boss cutscenes.\n",

This game has a few powerups introduced in Final Fight Guy: one that gives a 1-Up and one that grants brief invincibility.",

    "about": "\n\nGolden Axe created the hack n' slash sub-genre of brawlers. Its weapons-based combat, screen-clearing magic attacks, mountable creatures, and barbarian aesthetic made it one of Sega's most successful early franchises. It's also notable for its short playtime, casual difficulty, and unique scoring system.\n",
    "trivia": "Golden Axe was developed by the same team as Altered Beast. Both games share the Chicken-Leg enemy. The characters in Streets of Rage II are named similarly to Golden Axe's fighters. Compare Axel Stone to Ax=Battler, Blaze Fielding to Tyris Flare, and Max Thunder to Gilius Thunderhead. Golden Axe uses scream samples from the following films: Commando, Rambo: First Blood, Conan the Barbarian, and An American Werewolf in London. Golden Axe uses a unique \"Strength\" system rather than a traditional score. It's calculated as follows:\nStrength = ((0.5 + 0.5L) * E * A) * M. L is the current level you're on (1-5). E is for Enemy. Normal enemies count as 1, bosses are 2, and Death=adder is 8. A is for the attack you kill the enemy with. Banging the top of their head followed by a kick is 3, a normal kick or throw is 2, and anything else is 1. Finally, this is multiplied by M, your Magic Multiplier (see below.) At the end of the game, your Strength for all kills is aggregated and then divided by the number of times you died to calculate your final score. It is possible to increase your Strength by skillfully using magic. After you kill an enemy, every time you hit them with magic afterwards multiplies your Strength. If you line up a row of Pots and quickly use magic before the enemy hits the ground, you can achieve ridiculously high Strength scores.",

Besides that, it's a mediocre brawler featuring choppy gameplay and forgettable music.\n",

It also has both third person shooter as well as action platforming stages.\n",

    "name": "Knights of the Round",

    "perspective": "2.5D",
    "about": "\n\nKnights of the Round is a hack 'n' slash brawler from Capcom. It innovates in no less than four ways: it introduced a blocking mechanic that grants temporary invincibility, your character gains experience and changes appearance, items can be broken up and shared, and killing the same type of enemy consecutively grants a bonus. It also has a one-of-a-kind melodic medieval soundtrack.\n",
    "trivia": "Knights of the Round is the least similar to Final Fight out of all Capcom's brawlers. Besides a death-blow attack, Knights of the Round distances itself from Capcom's genre-dominating classic by focusing on weapons-based combat against relatively few enemies and emphasizing advanced techniques. Every large item can be broken up into smaller pieces by attacking it. With the exception of the Salad, which can possibly go down in value, every other item grants more total points when broken apart. Do your best to attack every item and only grab it right away if it's about to disappear. Knights of the Round is the only brawler (and one of the few games, ever) where you change appearance as you level up. It's also the only arcade brawler with an experience system, although a small handful of console brawlers (most notably Double Dragon on NES) also use XP. Knights of the Round has a unique combo system. Killing the same type of enemy in a row multiplies the score by up to x4. Using this is key to leveling up all the way. In multiplayer games, everybody shares the same combo counter. Therefore, it's important to talk with your friends and try to kill enemies in the best order possible. Of course, this is hard if your friends suck at games. Knights of the Round has a unique blocking system that is unlike any other game. When you block an enemy's attack, you actually gain a few seconds of complete invincibility that you can use to punish the enemy with powerful attacks. Although blocking drags down almost every other brawler it's present in (see River City Ransom or Guardian Heroes), Knights of the Round does it right. Only Perceval is able to run.",

However, its insane style compensates for this."

The fighters are fairly unique and fun to use, but the enemy variety isn't the greatest so the combat can get boring in the latter portions of the game. The graphics are colorful and above average but the music isn't the greatest."

You can play as both Riggs and Murtaugh, each of which have their own health bar. You can switch out any time by walking off the side of the screen. Riggs is skilled with knives but Murtaugh has more powerful punches. Its combat engine is simple and emphasizes projectiles.\n",

    "about": "\n\nMighty Final Fight is an NES-exclusive parody game from Capcom. It's like Mega Man meets Final Fight. It features cute, super-deformed characters, bright colors, and an extremely catchy and melodic soundtrack. It plays like Final Fight except you only fight two opponents at once and there's now an experience system where you level up and gain new moves.\n",
    "trivia": "Mighty Final Fight is actually the third Final Fight game released, as it came out after Final Fight 2 on the SNES. The composers for this game, Setsuo Yamamoto and Yujo Takehara, also composed for Mega Man X, Final Fight 2, and a couple of Street Fighter games. This game has the opposite ending of Final Fight: instead of Guy beating up Cody because he was walking away from Jessica, Guy has to restrain horndog Cody from ruining Haggar's special moment with his daughter. This game is heavily influenced by the NES version of Double Dragon. Both games feature combat against two opponents at once and have an experience system where each move grants different XP and you gain new moves by leveling up. Mighty Final Fight is available on the GBA as part of Capcom Mini-Mix alongside Bionic Commando and Strider.",

It has an absurd visual style including a main character that's wearing red leopard pants and white sunglasses.\n",

Most of the enemies in this game are rip-offs of Final Fight. Most notably, there's a guy who looks identical to Andore (including the wallet chain thing) but has sunglasses.",

Most of these were localized out West but not under the Kunio license. Some examples include Nintendo World Cup on Game Boy and Crash 'n' The Boys on NES. \"Nekketsu\" is Japanese for \"hot-blooded.\" It's the name of Kunio's high school as well as a description of his character. \"Kōha\" means \"tough guy.\" Double Dragon II, also from Technōs, uses this game's unique right-left attacking system. However, in that game you can freely face left or right so you can use your powerful back kick all the time. This is the only arcade brawler that is single player only. Besides that, it has a remarkable number of features that brawlers to this day still use.",

    "about": "\n\nPanzer Bandit is an obscure two-player brawler for the Playstation. It's largely a Guardian Heroes rip-off, as it features the same three-lane system and fighting game-style advanced techniques. However, it carves out its own niche with a futuristic setting, emphasis on projectiles, and an energy bar used for super attacks that fills up when you attack. It also has a Mega Man-esque stage select system.\n",
    "trivia": "This is the only other game to adopt Guardian Heroes' three-lane gimmick. Even Advance Guardian Heroes abandoned the system. This is one of few brawlers that features a completely robotic character. Some others are Cosmo Police Galivan II: Arrow of Justice on the Super Famicom and Alien Storm for arcade.",

Although there is technically two-player support, they have to switch off rather than fight together. It's also the only arcade brawler without continues, and the only one that repeats when you finish it. After beating the game, Renegade repeats infinitely until you die. Golden Axe's Kanji logo has a hammer, sword, and axe hidden in it.",

It has unprecedented level designs such as a movie set, a rock show, and a huge Halloween party.\n",

Its gameplay emphasizes stunning enemies by knocking them down to critical health and keeping them onscreen so you can unleash a powerful Tornado Throw. Its steep challenge is defined by powerful enemies that demand mastery of brawler fundamentals to defeat. Its graphics feature gigantic sprites and several Mode 7 effects. Its ultra-catchy soundtrack is composed by Taito's legendary house band, Zuntata.\n",
    "trivia": "The original Sonic Blast Man for the arcades wasn't actually a beat 'em up. It was basically a punching bag attached to a screen that you have to hit as hard as humanly possible. However, these were kept for this release as the Hit Stages between levels. Of course, there's no punching bag, so you have to rotate the D-pad instead. Like the US localization of Final Fight before it, female enemies in this game were changed to males to appease Nintendo of America's censorship policies. There's also Sonic Blast Man II on SNES, but it's completely different. It abandons the innovative gameplay for something far more generic and has way smaller sprites, but at least it's two-player.",

Created as a direct competitor to Final Fight on the SNES, it established the gold standard for console beat 'em ups with its simple gameplay, configurable challenge, legendary OST, and lagless two-player simultaneous action.\n",
    "trivia": "Streets of Rage innovated the genre by adding the vault technique, which allows you to transition from a front to a back grab and unleash suplexes at will. The cover art features a Jason Voorhees-style enemy that isn't actually in the game. However, he would later make an appearance in Streets of Rage Remake on the PC. The cop car in the screen-clearing special attack animation is from another Sega game, Cyber Police E-SWAT. Additionally, the original title for this game was going to be Dragon SWAT or D-SWAT. Streets was developed by several members from Team Shinobi, who of course worked on the Shinobi series. It features the same font and several sound effects from Return of Shinobi on the Genesis. Streets of Rage is available on several modern platforms, including PSN, Xbox Live, Steam, Wii, 3DS, and even mobile phones. It's also part of the 6-Pak compilation on Sega Genesis along with Golden Axe. Streets of Rage was playable in arcades on Sega's Mega-Tech hardware, which was basically just a Genesis in an arcade cabinet. If you wait around on the character select screen long enough, Blaze will wink at you. Check out http://www.soronline.net for more Streets info!",

    "about": "\n\nStreets of Rage 2 is widely considered to be the best console brawler ever created. It improves upon its predecessor across the board with deeper combat, more diverse characters, elaborate multi-part stages, and an even greater challenge. Its soundtrack is the stuff of legend.\n",
    "trivia": "In the Japanese box art, Axel strongly resembles Jean-Claude Van Damme and Mr. X looks quite a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger. There are a few hidden tracks in the sound test that aren't present in the actual game. Track 9 is a hot little ditty entitled Little Money Avenue. It was originally intended for a bonus stage but that idea was scrapped during development. Yuzo Koshiro voices all the characters in this game. For Blaze, he sped up the recording to make it sound female. In the Japanese version, Blaze's jump kick has a different animation showing her panties. This was changed for obvious reasons in the US and PAL releases. The US version is known as Streets of Rage 2, in PAL regions it's Streets of Rage II, and in Japan it's known as Bare Knuckle II: The Requiem of the Deadly Battle. Streets of Rage II is available on a ton of platforms, including Game Gear, Sega Master System, PSN, Xbox Live, Wii, Steam, and even mobile phones. The \"It's like Boo!\" signs in the stadium stage are likely a reference to how the fat guy enemies have a similar flying bellyflop attack to the character Boo from the Dragonball Z series. Many enemy names are references to anime characters, mostly from Berserk and Fist of the North Star. Some examples are Caska, Griphis, Heart, and Vehelits. Konami seemed to rip-off Blaze's design for April O'Neil in TMNT: Tournament Fighters on the Genesis. The only thing distinguishing April are blue gloves and a bandanna. In the beta, Axel's stationary special attack was a spinning hurricane kick rather than his signature Dragon Wing. Also, Max's walk animation was more ape-like. When you enter a new area or defeat a wave on an elevator section, your health is restored slightly. Lower difficulties restore more health than challenging ones. This feature was likely implemented to give the player a greater incentive to use special attacks, which cost health. Therefore, you basically get one free special per area because it's going to be restored soon anyway. Only Skate is able to run.",

    "about": "\n\nStreets of Rage 3 is the explosive final chapter to Sega's outstanding console brawler franchise. It improves upon Streets 2 with star-based dash attacks, vertical rolling, rechargeable specials, semi-branching stages, tons of new enemies, and much faster gameplay. It also features a controversial new soundtrack based on underground Detroit techno. The US version was severely neutered with an altered story, removed content, and baffling color-swaps so this page will focus on Bare Knuckle III, the original Japanese release.\n",
    "trivia": "Sega of America butchered Bare Knuckle III into Streets of Rage 3 in a handful of ways. First, they color-swapped the characters (and did an amateur job) which makes the sprites pop out less. Secondly, they changed the story and removed the bombing subplot. They also removed Ash, the gay stereotype character, which is somewhat understandable. Additionally, they made Streets of Rage 3 way, way harder and reduced the number of difficulty settings by 1. So, at least Streets 3 is appealing to truly experts Streets players because it offers the greatest challenge in the series. A large part of the soundtrack was generated by randomized beat generation software, apparently. Also, Yuzo did not directly compose most of the music and instead handed the reigns to his protege, Motohiro Kawashima. Yuzo recorded all the voices for Bare Knuckle III, but Sega of America used different actors for each character when they re-dubbed Streets 3. There are four endings: first, if you play on easy, the game will end immediately after defeating Robo X with a cutscene telling you to try harder. Second, if you fail to save the guy at the end of stage 6, you'll go to stage 7B and fight Shiva while Mr. X looks on from a far-off room. Third, if you reach Neo X and die, a bomb goes off and you get the bad ending. Finally, if you beat Neo X in time, you'll get the good ending. Max and Adam from the previous games appear in the credits. Streets of Rage 3 is available on Genesis, Steam, PSN and Xbox Live. Otohime and Yasha's team-based projectile attack is actually a fat man riding a horse. Axel's headband-tying intro scene in Bare Knuckle III is a rip-off of the same scene from Rambo III. Every time you get 40,000 points without dying, you gain a star. If you die, you lose a star and your point counter is reset (meaning if you die with 50,000 points, you need to get 90,000 points for another star.) Stars permanently upgrade your dash-attack. You can also execute your star moves with cheater combos using the X button on the Genesis 6-button controller. The beta version featured motorcycle segments where a Donovan on the back of a truck would throw barrels at you while bikers ride by and toss grenades. This was cut before the final release but was restored in Streets of Rage Remake.",

It has Streets 3's combat engine, including star-based dash attacks and a recharging energy bar, although you can change the rules to make it more like Streets 2. It features a whopping 18 characters including three versions each of Axel and Blaze.\n",
    "trivia": "This game was developed by a small team of Spanish guys over the better part of a decade. They reverse-engineered the game mechanics by watching footage of the game and analyzing it frame-by-frame to perfectly recreate the Streets experience. To play as alternate SOR1/SOR2 versions of characters, you have to unlock it by spending coins in the shop. Then, on the character select screen, press the \"Series\" button to cycle between versions.",

Its simple yet challenging and fair gameplay combined with its explosive humor and personality solidified its place as a classic and set the stage for future Konami brawlers.\n",
    "trivia": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an adaptation of the 1987 cartoon series of the same name. Although the comic series came before, it lacked most of the iconic characters like Rocksteady, Bebop, Baxter Stockman, and Krang. Throws in this game don't work like any other brawler. Basically you get a free throw when you defeat an enemy. In Europe, TMNT are known as the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles. Due to the fact that the holocaust happened there, Europe (and especially Germany) has far harsher censorship than the US. The term \"Ninja\" was deemed too violent so it was changed to \"Hero\" instead. This is the only TMNT game where you fight Baxter Stockman in his human form. In all other titles, you fight him after he's mutated into a fly-man.",

Its combat is a straightforward punch/kick system with a handful of weapons including whips, sticks, and guns. This game is well-known for its brutal difficulty and super catchy music.\n",

Also, each dwarf counts as a hitpoint that can be regained by attacking him when he's down.\n",

    "about": "\n\nTMNT on the GBA is based off the CGI film of the same name featuring the Heroes in a Half-shell. Its simple combat is surprisingly challenging and is supported by light RPG and exploration elements. You can play as all four turtles and switch off between stages. There are also a handful of side activities in the form of minigames and shopping.\n",
    "trivia": "This game is not to be confused with Konami's TMNT on the GBA, which is actually an action platformer rather than a brawler. Unfortunately, classic Ninja Turtle enemies like Bebop, Rocksteady, and even Shredder weren't featured in the movie this game was based off of, which explains the lame enemies.",

Although the enemy designs are generic and bland, their gameplay is very well-designed. The character animations and backgrounds are both high-quality, although the music is just average. It also has some RPG elements."

The combat lacks throws but it has two types of stock-based death-blows as well as a charged projectile attack of hoisin sauce.\n",

    "about": "\n\nUndercover Cops is Irem's attempt at a Final Fight-style brawler. It features simple yet challenging gameplay, bizarre enemy design, phenomenal audiovisual presentation, and a one-of-a-kind personality. It introduced the concept of ultimate attacks, which are basically death-blows on steroids. It also has a unique \"Finess Trick\" system that rewards using advanced techniques.\n",
    "trivia": "Undercover Cops is basically an alternate version of Final Fight. Zan is Guy, Rosa is Cody, and Matt is Haggar. Dr. Crayton, like Belger, is a short, cheating bad guy who has an easy first form followed by a hard second. And both games are about a city overrun by crime that has to be cleaned up by three vigilantes. The US port of Undercover Cops is one of the worst cases of executive meddling in any brawler, perhaps even worse than Streets of Rage III. They renamed the characters and changed their backstories, removed about half the attacks, took out or changed several pieces of background art, and removed the voice samples from the music. There existed an Alpha version at some point that didn't have these issues, and there's even an Alpha Renewal kit that restored the normal version to its former glory, although both of these are ridiculously rare. Undercover Cops has a board game RPG (similar to Sugoro Quest) spin-off on the Game Boy called Undercover Cops Hakaishin Garumaa. It's barely playable if you don't speak Japanese although the characters are the only thing that makes it an \"Undercover Cops\" game. One of the items in this game is R-Type. R-Type is Irem's most successful franchise by far. It's a hard-as-nails space shooter with an H.R. Giger art style.",

It's one of the best looking and sounding games on the system.\n",

    "about": "\n\nVendetta is the second game in Konami's Crime Fighters trilogy. Although it features goofy humor, 4-player simultaneous gameplay, and moderate challenge, it breaks from tradition with its huge movesets and strong emphasis on items. In fact, this is hands-down the most weapons-heavy beat 'em up. It's got bats, knives, whips, chains, and even a shotgun.\n",
    "trivia": "Vendetta is one of the only brawlers with fighters that feature realistic human proportions. Blood, Boomer, and Sledge have musculature that can be realistically achieved without the use of steroids. Although Hawk is huge, he's actually a little smaller than Hulk Hogan in his prime. Vendetta is the US version of Crime Fighters 2. Like Crime Fighters before it, several elements were removed in the US release. Most notably, the gay stereotype and humping dog enemies have been completely cut.",

Its combat features an energy-based ultimate attack as well as special techniques with Street Fighter-style inputs. It also has light RPG elements in the form of stat upgrades between stages. Its graphics are smoothly animated and vibrant while its soundtrack is a mixture of rock and techno.\n",
    "trivia": "This game also features X-Men favorites like Nightcrawler and Gambit, but they only appear as bosses. To execute a special attack, press quarter-cirle-forwards (down, down-right, right) + A.",
